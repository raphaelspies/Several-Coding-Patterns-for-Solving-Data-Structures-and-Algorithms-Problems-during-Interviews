// Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find all unique quadruplets in it, whose sum is equal to the target number.

// This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Triplet Sum to Zero.

// We can follow a similar approach to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time. At every step during the iteration, we will search for the quadruplets similar to Triplet Sum to Zero whose sum is equal to the given target.
